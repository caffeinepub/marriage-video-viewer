# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Build a marriage video viewer application where users can upload video files, browse them in a gallery, and watch them directly in the browser.

**Planned changes:**
- Create backend storage system for video file uploads with metadata (title, upload date, file size)
- Build video gallery interface displaying all videos with thumbnails and titles in a grid/list layout
- Implement in-browser video player with standard controls (play, pause, volume, fullscreen)
- Create upload interface with file selection and progress indication
- Apply elegant wedding-themed visual design with warm colors, refined typography, and spacious layouts

**User-visible outcome:** Users can upload marriage videos through a drag-and-drop interface, browse all uploaded videos in an elegant gallery, and watch them directly in the browser with full playback controls, all styled with a celebratory wedding aesthetic.
